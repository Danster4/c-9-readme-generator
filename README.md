  ## Credits

  ## License
  There is currently no license for this application at this time.

  ## Features
  The main feature of this application is using the power of JavaScript and Node.js to dynamically create a README.md file without the user writing a line of markdown in an actual README.md file. The command line prompts will fill in the answers to create the file for the user automatically.
